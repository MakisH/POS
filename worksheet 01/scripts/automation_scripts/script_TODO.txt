NATHAN:

DONE 1. create Makefile that accepts environment variable for flags
DONE 2. write Python script (modify MakeCreate.py) that, for all flag combinations:

DONE A. grabs combination of flags
DONE B. sets ${FLAGS}
DONE C. runs make with this combination of flags
DONE D. then, executes the seq.ll job script for this combination


MAKIS:

Run LLU: load leveler user - shows me my queue
combine with grep
See if job is completed, process output file. 
Take the performance metric from output file into a variable. 
You have times of smaller combinations, then you want times of bigger combinations.
