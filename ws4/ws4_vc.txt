Section 2.2:

Describe the transformations from point-to-point to collective operations that were applied to the code. Additionally, answer the following questions:
• Would you expect performance or scalability benefits from the changes in this application? Explain. • Is the resulting code easier to understand and maintain after the changes? If yes, why?

3.2 Required Video Commentary

Describe the transformations from POSIX to MPI-IO operations that were applied to the code. Additionally, answer the following questions:
• What is "Data Sieving" and "2-Phase IO"? How do they help improve IO performance?
• Was the original implementation scalable in terms of IO performance?
• Was the original implementation scalable in terms of RAM storage?
• How much of the communication in the application was replaced with MPI-IO operations?
