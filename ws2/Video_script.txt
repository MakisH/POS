3.1: PARALLEL PROGRAMMING ERRORS

Race Condition

(From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#Software)

A race c
ondition is when the output is dependent on the sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events. It becomes a bug when events do not happen in the order the programmer intended. The term originates with the idea of two signals racing each other to influence the output first.

Deadlock

A deadlock is a situation in which two or more competing actions are each waiting for the other to finish, and thus neither ever does.

Heisenbug (observer’s effect)

(From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug)

A heisenbug is a software bug that seems to disappear or alter its behavior when one attempts to study it.
Heisenbugs occur because common attempts to debug a program, such as inserting output statements or running it in a debugger, usually modify the code, change the memory addresses of variables and the timing of its execution.


Floating-point arithmetic challenges

Comparisons

(see http://floating-point-gui.de/errors/comparison/)

Due to rounding errors, most floating-point numbers end up being slightly imprecise. As long as this imprecision stays small, it can usually be ignored. However, it also means that numbers expected to be equal (e.g. when calculating the same result through different correct methods) often differ slightly, and a simple equality test fails. 

Definition of a zero and signed zeros

(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_zero)

In floating point numbers zero is signed so there is a positive zero and a negative zero. In most run-time environments, positive zero is usually printed as "0" and the negative zero as "-0". This can cause a problem in some instances. 1/(−0) returns negative infinity, while 1/+0 returns positive infinity.

Cancellation or loss of significance

(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_significance)

Loss of significance occurs when an operation on two numbers increases relative error substantially more than it increases absolute error, for example in subtracting two nearly equal numbers (known as catastrophic cancellation). 

Amplification and error

(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-off_error)

Amplification errors occur when a number cannot be represented exactly in floating point arithmetic. Then, if a series of calculations is performed on an unexactly represented number, this error is amplified. 

4.2.1: ASPECTS OF TOTAL VIEW'S GUI

Session Manager:

https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/totalview/#SessionManager

Provides an easy way to:
Launch a new program - serial or parallel
Attach to a running program
Load a core file
Save a debug session for later
Load a previously saved debug session

https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/totalview/#Windows

Root Window:

Will always appear when the TotalView GUI is started.
Provides an overview of all processes and threads, showing the TotalView assigned ID, MPI rank, host, status and brief description/name for each.
Allows sorting by ID, rank, host and status.
Provides the ability to expand/collapse each process to view/hide any included threads in that process.
Pull-down menus - File, Edit, View, Tools, Window, Help (menus are discussed later)

Process Window:

Usually (but not always) appears with the Root Window after TotalView is started.
By default, a single process window will display. For multi-process / multi-threaded programs however, every process and every thread may have its own Process Window if desired.
Comprised of:
Pull-down menus
Execution control buttons
Navigation control buttons
Process and thread status bars
4 "Panes"

Stack Trace Pane:

Shows the call stack of routines the current executable is running
Selection of any routine shown in the call stack will automatically update the Process Window with its information.

Stack Frame Pane:

Displays the local variables, registers and function parameters for the selected executable.
Register abbreviations and meanings are architecture specific. See the TotalView documentation for details.

Source Pane:

Displays source/assembler for the currently selected program or function.
Shows program counter, line numbers and any associated action points.
Only "boxed" line numbers are eligible for debugging.

Action Points, Processes, Threads Pane:

A multi-function pane. By default, it shows any action points (covered later) that have been set.
May also select Processes to show attached processes or Threads to show associated threads.
The Action Points display is shown above. The Processes and Threads displays are shown below.

Variable Window:

Probably the most common window after the Root and Process windows.
Appears when you dive (covered later) on a variable or select a menu item to view variable information.
Displays detailed information about selected program variables. Also permits editing, diving, filtering and sorting of variable data.
Comprised of a single pane, pull-down menus, data field boxes and several action buttons.

4.3.1: ASPECTS OF TOTAL VIEW'S GUI

Control execution:
See https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/totalview/#ControllingExecution

Setting breakpoints:

See https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/totalview/#Breakpoint

Diving into functions:

https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/totalview/#Diving

View memory (variables and arrays):

Memory Areas
Use the variable lookup command:
	Process Window  >  View Menu  >  Lookup Variable 
Then enter either a hexadecimal address (must start with 0x) for a single location. Enter two hexadecimal addresses for a range.

5.1: FORK-JOIN MODEL

see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork%E2%80%93join_model

The fork–join model is a way of setting up and executing parallel programs, such that execution branches off in parallel at designated points in the program, to "join" (merge) at a subsequent point and resume sequential execution. Parallel sections may fork recursively until a certain task granularity is reached. Fork–join can be considered a parallel design pattern.
